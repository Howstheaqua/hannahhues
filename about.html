          <h3>Me</h3>
          <div>
            <p>My name is Hannah Grubb. I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I have been drawing
              since I was a child and have always had a passion for art. I have been working on my art skills
              for the past 10 years and have been able to improve my skills. I have been able to create a variety
              of different art styles.</p>

          <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
          <div>
            <p>A goal that have as an Illustrator is to be well-rounded and multifaceted. 
              The way that know I'm on the right track is that when start a piece, the world around me disappears.
              I don't answer my phone, and the hours slip past me. I really love creating. 
              Usually I am a perfectionist, so I keep on doing my work until am satisfied. I cannot just give up or say 
              "Well, guess that's good enough"-- It has to be up to my standard. I also am able to get things done 
              relatively quickly, as I get in a groove when I start projects.</p>
